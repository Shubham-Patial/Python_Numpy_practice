# Exercises Notebook --- NumPy & Data Manipulation

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that walks through a series
of beginner-friendly NumPy exercises. It is designed to help you build
confidence with array creation, reshaping, slicing, type conversions,
and basic data analysis tasks. A small Sudoku-validation exercise is
also included.

## Contents

### 1. NumPy Fundamentals

-   Creating 1D, 2D, and 3D NumPy arrays\
-   Converting array data types\
-   Slicing arrays with different step sizes\
-   Reshaping arrays into new dimensions

### 2. Sudoku Validation (NumPy-Based)

-   Representing a 9×9 grid using NumPy\
-   Checking rows, columns, and 3×3 subgrids\
-   Applying logical comparisons efficiently

### 3. Student Data Analysis

-   Counting students below a certain age\
-   Calculating subject-wise averages\
-   Filtering students based on score thresholds\
-   Replacing values using boolean masks

## Requirements

    pip install numpy jupyter

To launch the notebook:

    jupyter notebook
